# RyuMalwareDetect

Malware Detection

Generate Trend Micro Machine Learning Contest dataset to csv

1. Info Table
info table feature can be selected through modify the code in dataLoader.py
please execute the command below:

~> python dataLoader.py yourpath/dataset/

train_info.csv, test_info.csv will be generate.

The column titles are below:

md5, feature1, feature2, ... featureN


2. asm File

assemble op code feature generator, for extract feature from assembly code.

Features are op-codes, surveyed from wiki and other internet web sites.


asm_dataLoader.py will count the basic op-codes in asm_codes.txt and asm_codes3.txt

asm_dataLoader_multiprocess.py will count the basic op-codes in asm_codes.txt and asm_codes3.txt with multi-thread.

asm_dataLoader_multiprocess_megashinka.py will count extra op-codes in asm_codes4.txt with multi-thread.


3. run training and testing
Load RyuCore-Main or RomXGBoost file in ipython notebook or install anaconda and run jupyter notebook. 
The steps of RyuCore-Main is 

> 1. define file parser

> 2. load csv file to pandas dataframe

> 3. train data from training dataset

> 4. fit training data and predict test dataset

> 5. export the predict result in csv file


# Feature selection
Feature importance analysis is impliment in RyuCore, using ExtraTreeClassifier and run feature_importances_  method. Drop unimportant feature with 0 percentage of usage after training. 

# Result
AUC score is above 0.998 from gxboost calissifier through training data with cross validation and feature selection
